Dear {{ user.username }},

You have been invited to use Do It Together (DIT)!  This is a project 
to track commitments socially.  The idea is, you are more likely to accomplish 
what you set out to do if other people are supporting you and holding you
to account for it.

Please go to the following page and choose a new password:{% block reset_link %}
{{ protocol }}://{{ domain }}{% url django.contrib.auth.views.password_reset_confirm uidb36=uid, token=token %}
{% endblock %}

Then you can log in at:  {{ protocol }}:{{ domain }}{% url commitmenttable %} 

If you have received this email in error, please accept my apologies.  
In case of any system problem, you can call me at 215-729-2556.

Sincerely,
Paul Dexter
